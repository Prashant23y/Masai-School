<!-- Create a basic HTML page to demonstrate your understanding of the DOM and its structure. Your task is to write JavaScript that performs the following actions:

Select the <h1> element by its id and change its text content to "Welcome to the DOM World!".
Select all <p> elements using getElementsByTagName and set their text color to blue.
Use querySelector to select the first <div> with the class container and change its background color to yellow.
Ensure that your HTML structure includes at least one <h1>, multiple <p> elements, and a <div> with the class container. -->
