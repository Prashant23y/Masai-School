<!-- Create a basic webpage that includes the following semantic HTML elements: <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, and <article>. Each element should contain sample content relevant to its role.

In the <header>, add a heading with the title of the webpage and a <nav> element with links to "Home," "About," and "Contact."
In the <section>, add two <article> elements with a heading and paragraph each to simulate blog posts or news entries.
In the <footer>, include a copyright statement.
Ensure each semantic tag is used correctly and meaningfully within the structure of the HTML document. -->
