        <h1>Hello, I am Prashant Kumar</h1>
            <p>
            I am currently studying in Masai School where 
            I am learning about full stack web development.

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> 
                I am a passionate and curious coding enthusiast, currently diving deep into web development and expanding my skills every day. 
                I approach challenges calmly and confidently, both in life and in learning, with patience that helps me solve problems without
                frustration. My goal is to become a successful web developer and eventually launch my own tech company. To prepare for that journey,
                I aim to first gain real-world experience working in the IT industry, so I can understand the challenges and opportunities involved
                in building and running a startup. 
            </p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>  
                I enjoy playing cricket and chess—cricket helps me stay physically active and healthy, while chess sharpens my focus, strategic thinking,
                and decision-making skills. In my free time, I love watching movies and listening to music as a way to relax and refresh my mind. Back during
                my intermediate studies, I had a strong habit of reading biographies and informative articles to gain knowledge. Although I stepped away from 
                that habit for a while, I’m now planning to get back into reading and make it a part of my routine again.
